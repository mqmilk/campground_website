# campground_website
For test purpose, you need to run npm install, create a .env file with the MAPBOX_TOKEN and DB_URL(the mongo Atlas url for your server. For test, you can use local computer as server) in the main folder, and then you should be able to go to http://localhost:3000/.
You can CRUD(create, read, update, delete) the campgrounds in the website, and authentication and authorization are needed for some features(like create new campground, leave a review for a campground, delete a campground, or delete a existed review). For the uploaded files(images), you use your computer as a local server to save them and when you delete an image, the related saved file will be deleted in the backend as well. 
Mapbox is used to locate the campgrounds, and you can click on the map to redirect to the specific campground you want to check.
